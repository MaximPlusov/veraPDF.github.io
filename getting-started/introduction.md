The veraPDF GUI
---------------
Once you've installed the software the GUI is the quickest and easiest way to
try it out. You can read more about using the GUI [here on this documentation site](/gui).

The veraPDF CLI
---------------
While the GUI offers access to all of veraPDF's functionality it's not a
practical way of automating veraPDF tasks or saving the results for large
batches. If you'd like a little more power and flexibility you should use the
command line interface that's also installed, our getting started guide is
[available here](/cli).
